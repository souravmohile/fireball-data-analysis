# Fireball and Bolide Data Analysis

This project analyzes fireball and bolide events using data from NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies (CNEOS). The dataset provides information on the location, velocity, impact energy, and other characteristics of meteor events.

## Project Overview
The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Checking Correlations
- Visualization of fireball events on a globe
- Analysis of occurrences by year, month, day, and hour
- Impact energy vs. velocity, altitude, and other variables

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the analysis. Ensure that you have the dataset stored in the correct location.
